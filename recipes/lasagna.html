        <p>
            Lasagna is a beloved Italian dish known for its rich layers of flavor and hearty, comforting appeal. It traditionally consists of wide, flat pasta sheets layered with a variety of fillings, which often include a savory blend of ground meats, such as beef or sausage, a tomato-based sauce, and creamy b√©chamel or ricotta cheese. These layers are typically seasoned with garlic, onions, and a medley of Italian herbs like basil and oregano, creating a complex, aromatic profile. Once assembled, the lasagna is baked until bubbling and golden, with a deliciously crisp top layer of melted cheese. Versatile and customizable, lasagna can be adapted to include vegetables, different cheeses, or even alternative protein sources, making it a versatile favorite for family dinners, special occasions, and gatherings.
